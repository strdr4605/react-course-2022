## Homework

Create a react app with following components: `<App />`, `<Pokemon />`:

The app should have one state (a pokemon).
Using a `useEffect` hook and `fetch` do a request to [PokÃ©mon API](https://pokeapi.co/) and get the desired pokemon and store it into the app state.
You should do a request for the pokemon name that starts with first letter of your name.  

Examples:  
If your name starts with `D` you may do a request to `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto`.  
If your name starts with `T` you may do a request to `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/tentacool`.  

A list of pokemon names can be found [here](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon).

> Note: Make sure to do a request with lowercase name `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto`, Not `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/Ditto`

After getting the pokemon display on webpage the following info:
- Pokemon name
- Pokemon base experience
- Weight
- Height
- Front image of pokemon (images can be found in `pokemonData.sprites.`)
